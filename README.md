# SoyChain

SoyChain aims to solve the challenges in the supply chain from Ukrainian soybean farmers to a Swiss distributor. It ensures full traceability along the whole chain back to the field.

SoyChain runs on the Hyperledger Fabric framework and is developed with Hyperledger Composer.

Note: The frontend demo is not completely up to date.
